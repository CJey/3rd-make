Description: MQTT broker tailored for LikeIT
 Mosquitto is an open source (EPL/EDL licensed) message broker that 
 implements the MQTT protocol versions 3.1 and 3.1.1. MQTT provides
 a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish /
 subscribe model. This makes it suitable for "Internet of Things" 
 messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as
 phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers like the Arduino.
